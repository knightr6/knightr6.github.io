	<p>Low water and the kids are fishing at moores dam and power plant. In the summer the water rises and lowers significantly according to recent rainfall. The river changes daily and Moores Park is a unique point of intererst which tells the story of the watershed of a very large area of the county and more.</p>

	<p>The seagulls like the river too. The bouys are above the falls at the Board of Water & Light power plant.</p>

	<p>Fisherman below the damn at higher water. Moores Park is across the river from the power plant. This is a city park immediately south of downtown in the Reo area; or, just down the hill if you are walking.</p>

<p><a href="riverworks/waldumar.html"><img src="thumbnails/waldumar_01_thumb.jpg" 
	alt="trail at the park"></a></p>
	<p>^ Up river of downtown, and not very far, is Waldumar Nature Center. There are a number of choice locations at Waldumar to view the The Grand River.  There are plenty of hiking trails too.</p>
	<p>> Down stream of the winding Grand River, is; counterintuitively, North Town.  The fish ladder and old power station in North Town is another a great location to enjoy the river and the day.</p>

	<p>This is a nice section of the river trail at Reo Town on one of those warm days late in the month of December.</p>

	<p>Any day and every day seems to be a good day to enjoy the river and walk the trail.</p>
